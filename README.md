# Automatic-Attendence-System-with-Facial-Recognition
while using this you  can use python version from 10 to python 3.8 so that  the facial recognition library doesn't  create any error.
and another error that you can encounter is dlib error or building wheels you have to externally download that zip file there are many tutorial available on youtube for solution.
also make sure to install all libraries through the terminal for the same.
thats all you are good to go .

To run this on your device just write pip install -r requirements in your terminal.

I have also provided link for the dlib error if it occur's.
